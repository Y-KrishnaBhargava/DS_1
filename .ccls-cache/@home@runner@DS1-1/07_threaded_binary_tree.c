/*

observations :

Purpose: The code is designed to convert a binary tree into a threaded binary tree and perform an inorder traversal on it. A threaded binary tree makes inorder traversal faster and does possible without stack or without recursion.
Structures and Variables: The node structure is defined with key, left, right, and isThreaded fields. key holds the value of the node, left and right are pointers to the left and right child nodes respectively, and isThreaded is a boolean that indicates whether the right pointer is a normal right pointer or a pointer to the inorder successor.

Functions: The code includes several functions:
createThreaded: This function converts a binary tree into a threaded binary tree. It recursively traverses the tree in a reverse inorder manner and makes all possible right pointers to point to the inorder successor.

leftMost: This function is used to find the leftmost node in a binary tree. Itâ€™s used in the inOrder function to start the traversal from the leftmost node.

inOrder: This function performs an inorder traversal on a threaded binary tree. It starts from the leftmost node and follows the threaded links.

newNode: This function creates a new node with the given key.

Memory Allocation: The newNode function uses malloc to allocate memory for new nodes. The main function also uses malloc to allocate memory for the root node. However, there are no checks to see if malloc returns NULL, which can lead to undefined behavior if the memory allocation fails.

Sample Tree: In the main function, a sample binary tree is created for demonstration purposes. The tree is then converted into a threaded binary tree, and an inorder traversal is performed.

Output: The output of the program will be the inorder traversal of the created threaded binary tree, printed to the console.

Error Handling: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. For instance, it does not check if malloc successfully allocates memory.

Portability: The code uses standard C library functions and should be portable across different platforms that support C.
